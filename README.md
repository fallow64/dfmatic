# DFMatic
A toy programming language that transpiles to the [Diamondfire](https://mcdiamondfire.com) Minecraft server.

## How To Use
1. Download the JAR from [the releases section](https://github.com/fallow64/dfmatic/releases).
2. Run the JAR with the file path of the source code. `java -jar dfmatic.jar mySourceCode.dfm`
3. For CodeUtils/ItemAPI support use the flag `-c` (like `java -jar dfmatic.jar mySourceCode.dfm -c`). Although, the integration is very buggy.

Check out the [wiki](https://github.com/fallow64/dfmatic/wiki) for documentation!
